# Beat Saber MVP

## My Understanding of Beat Saber Controls:

### Core Elements:
**1. Hand/Controller Tracking**
- Track both VR controllers in 3D space
- Detect controller position, rotation, and velocity
- Map to virtual "sabers" or tools in the scene

**2. Motion Detection**
- Detect swinging motions (velocity + direction)
- Recognize different gesture types (slash, stab, block)
- Track motion trails/paths for visual feedback

**3. Collision Detection**
- Ray casting or mesh collision between controller/saber and targets
- Precise timing detection for rhythm-based interactions
- Hit validation (correct angle, speed, timing)

### Implementation Approach:

**1. Controller Representation**
```javascript
// Visual representation of controllers as sabers/tools
const leftSaber = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("leftSaber", {...}, scene);
const rightSaber = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("rightSaber", {...}, scene);
```

**2. Motion Tracking**
```javascript
// Track controller movement over time
xrInput.onControllerAddedObservable.add((controller) => {
    // Track position/rotation changes
    // Calculate velocity and acceleration
});
```

**3. Target Objects**
- Objects that respond to saber hits
- Different colored targets for different sabers
- Scoring/feedback system

**4. Visual Effects**
- Motion trails behind sabers
- Hit effects and particles
- UI feedback for scoring

### Key Questions:
- What specific interactions do you want? (slicing objects, hitting targets, blocking?)
- Should it be rhythm-based or free-form interaction?
- Do you want visual saber representations or abstract tools?

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Controller Access
- Get access to VR controller data through WebXR input system
- Listen for controller connection events  
- Track left/right controller positions and rotations
- Log data to console to verify tracking works

### Phase 2: Visual Saber Representation
- Create visible "sabers" that follow controller movements
- Use cylinder or box primitives with red/blue colors
- Attach sabers to controllers with proper positioning offset
- Update saber position/rotation every frame based on controller transform

### Phase 3: Motion Trails
- Track recent positions of saber tips
- Create trail geometry connecting recent positions
- Add fade effects over time for visual feedback
- Enhance visual impact of saber movement

### Phase Questions:
- Visual Style: Simple colored cylinders or more elaborate saber design?
- Hand Assignment: Automatic detection or fixed left/right assignment?
- Debugging: Should we show controller position data on screen?
